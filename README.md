# Topic modeling
    
    Due on Friday Nov 8.

Based on the Movie Plots data (from Friday's class), use topic modeling to group movies in the data set by similarity, as we did in class on Friday (Nov 1). Visualize the results. Can you name the topics?

Experiment with adjustments to the number of topics, number of clusters, and term weightings in the Document Term Matrix to improve your results.

Prepare a document using Quarto that contains the R scripts used in your topic modeling. Include visualizations in your document (e.g., cluster plots, scree plots for k, gamma plots, and beta plots) and explain their meaning. (See the [ldatuning](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ldatuning/index.html) package for details about scree plots to help pick k for LDA modeling)

Make an artsy-looking word cloud.

Submit a link to your github.  Make sure both the you have both the qmd source and pdf document in your repo.
