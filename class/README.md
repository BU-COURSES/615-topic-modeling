# Nov 1 - Topic Modeling

We'll use these datasets to demonstrate topic modeling and clustering. These datasets will also be what you need to complete the assignment for this topic.

We've also included the data cleaning script and the original text datasets if you want to explore this with more genres/fewer genres or different genres. (These files are `test_data.txt`, `test_data_solution.txt` and `Data_cleaning.R`)
